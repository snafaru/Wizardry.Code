Wizardry Proving Grounds v3.0 - Boot Side Code Changes
======================================================

From Thomas William Ewer's reverse engineered Pascal source code (and assembler code) of Wizardry it is now possible to fix the game code itself.


Bug/Issue #:	ST002 - Bypass Copy Protection Check
====================================================

Status:		Fixed. Recompiled. Verified.

Date of change:	25-Dec-2022

Contributor:	E. Labelle (Information source: Thomas W. Ewers)

The Issue:	After putting a new compiled version of SYSTEM.STARTUP (STARTUP.CODE) on a Wizardry boot disk, the latter will hang on boot. This is due to the copy protection scheme used. Note: Skipping the write-protect check has not been implemented yet, therefore do not forget to write-protect your boot disk, else it will hang.

The Fix:	Remark out the copy protection check to bypass it.	

Source Disk:	Wiz1E.dsk

File:		STARTUP.TEXT

Segment:	PROCEDURE CHKCOPY;  (* P07004 *)

Code From:

          IF GOODCOPY THEN *)

Code To:	Putting the code between "(* " and " *)" makes it a remark and thus it is skipped, therefore bypassing the copy protection check. 

          (* ST001 REMARK OUT/BYPASS COPY PROTECTION CHECK *)
          (* IF GOODCOPY THEN *)

Final Compiled File Name:	SYSTEM.STARTUP

Destination Disk:		Any Wizardry Proving Grounds boot disk.
